      <ol style="padding-left:0px">

      <p> Potential PhD students that have an interest in exploring research questions related to the carbon and water cycles and their responses to global change, are particularly encouraged to get in contact. Students should have a background in biology, mathematics, physics, atmospheric science, engineering or a similar quantitative sciences. </p>

      <p> <b><i>How complex should a land surface model be to accurately predict extremes?</i></b> </br>

      <br>We live in a data-rich world, yet the representations of the land surface in climate models were largely conceived in the absence of observations. Comparisons against observations identify model weaknesses; this then fuels a drive towards increased model complexity. How much of this added complexity is warranted? This project aims to build the simplest model of the terrestrial biosphere that the data can support. The project will combine a data-driven approach with the principles of optimality theory. By delivering a simpler, data- and theory-driven model we will unlock new understanding about climate model behaviour to improve predictions of climate extremes.</p>

      <p> The project is based at the <a href="http://www.ccrc.unsw.edu.au" style="text-decoration: none;">Climate Change Research Centre (CCRC)</a> at the University of New South Wales (UNSW), Australia, under the supervision of Dr Martin De Kauwe, <a href="http://www.ccrc.unsw.edu.au/ccrc-team/academic-research/lisa-alexander" style="text-decoration: none;">Associate Professor Lisa Alexander</a> and <a href="http://www.ccrc.unsw.edu.au/ccrc-team/academic-research/andy-pitman" style="text-decoration: none;">Professor Andrew Pitman</a>. </p>

      <p> We are looking for expressions of interest from outstanding graduates with a strong academic record including Honours Class I or equivalent. Graduates with a strong background in mathematics, physics, atmospheric science, engineering or a similar quantitative science are particularly encouraged to apply. Programming experience with fortran 90, Python or R is highly desirable.</p>

      <p> Questions may be directed to Martin De Kauwe (m.dekauwe@unsw.edu.au).
      Further details about the Scientia PhD Scholarship Scheme may be found <a href="https://www.2025.unsw.edu.au/apply/" style="text-decoration: none;">here</a>. Expressions of interest will be open until the 20 July 2018, with final decisions made in November. </p>

      <p> <b><i>The short and long-term effects of climate change on vegetation</i></b> </br>

      <br>Climatic change is set to reconfigure ecological systems, as key drivers of vegetation composition and function - such as rainfall and temperature - shift away from their historical norms. Vegetation will respond over a range of timescales, from short-term acclimation, to medium-term adjustments in the abundance of current species, to long-term adaptation and/ or replacement of species. In this project, the student will compare the pace and impact of these different responses, using process-based models; and then outline scenarios of alternative future states. Insight gained will underpin effective ecosystem management..</p>

      <p> The project is based at the University of New South Wales (UNSW), Australia, under the supervision of <a href="http://www.bees.unsw.edu.au/daniel-falster" style="text-decoration: none;">Dr Daniel Falster</a>, <a href="http://www.bees.unsw.edu.au/will-cornwell" style="text-decoration: none;">Associate Professor Will Cornwall</a> and Dr Martin De Kauwe. </p>

      <p> We are looking for expressions of interest from outstanding graduates with a strong academic record including Honours Class I or equivalent. Graduates with a strong background in biology, mathematics, physics, atmospheric science, engineering or a similar quantitative science are particularly encouraged to apply. Programming experience with C, fortran 90, Python or R is highly desirable. Strong drive to understand the dynamics of plant ecosystems is essential.</p>

      <p> Questions may be directed to Daniel Falster (daniel.falster@unsw.edu.au>).
      Further details about the Scientia PhD Scholarship Scheme may be found <a href="https://www.2025.unsw.edu.au/apply/" style="text-decoration: none;">here</a>. Expressions of interest will be open on the 28th of May 2018. </p>
