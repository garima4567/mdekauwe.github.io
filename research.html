      <p> My research focuses on improving our understanding of land-atmosphere interactions, with an emphasis on forest ecosystems. I am particularly interested in ways to utilise observations, be it from leaf, stand or space, in order to test, constrain and scale model predictions. </p>

      <p> In 2008 I completed my PhD at UCL, under the supervision of <a href="http://www.geog.ucl.ac.uk/about-the-department/people/academic-staff/philip-lewis" style="color: rgb(0,0,0)">Philip Lewis</a>, <a href="http://www.geog.ucl.ac.uk/about-the-department/people/academic-staff/mat-disney" style="color: rgb(0,0,0)">Mat Disney</a> and <a href="http://www.geos.ed.ac.uk/homes/mwilliam" style="color: rgb(0,0,0)">Mathew Williams</a>. My PhD involved implementing a data assimilation scheme to combine satellite derived observations of the land surface with a simple carbon balance ecosystem model (DALEC). </p>

      <p> After completing my PhD I moved to the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH) to take up a position with the grand job title "Earth Observation and Land Surface Modeller". Here, I worked with Chris Taylor applying a spectral analysis approach to satellite data to characterise land surface responses to rainfall events in West Africa. </p>

      <p> Since 2010, I have been based on the bottom of the globe (from my perspective!), where I have been employed as a postdoc in Belinda Medlyn's Climate and Forest Ecosystem Modelling (CAFE M) lab. At Macquarie, I have been testing a suite of ecosystem models with data from a series of Free-Air CO<sub>2</sub> Enrichment (FACE) experiments, both from the US and here in Australia. The ultimate goal is to improve our ecosystem models (e.g. the Generic Decomposition and Yield, GDAY model), such that they more accurately represent elevated CO<sub>2</sub> effects on vegetation. </p>

      <p> Feel free to drop me an email if any of that sounds interesting! </p>
